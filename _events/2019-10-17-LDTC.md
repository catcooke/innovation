## Legislative Data and Transparency Conference

### Description
The 2019 Legislative Data and Transparency Conference (#LDTC2019) brings individuals from Legislative branch agencies together with data users and transparency advocates to foster a conversation about the use of legislative data – addressing how non-profits, individuals, and public and private agencies use technology well and how they can use it better in the future.
